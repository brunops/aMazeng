#aMazeng

* Generate random Mazes DFS algorithm
* Make two players compete to see who finds the way out first using Node.js with socket.io
* Display winner that finds the way out of the maze first

This project was developed in less than 24hrs and won one of the prizes at the first DBC Alumni Hackathon on 2013 for "most creative product".

You can play it at [http://amazeng.herokuapp.com](http://amazeng.herokuapp.com).

There's a post about it [in my blog](http://brunops.org/aMazeng) and one in [DBC's blog](http://devbootcamp.com/2013/12/20/first-annual-dbc-holiday-hackathon/) too.
